# Design System Improvements
## Color Theme & Typography Analysis

### Current State Analysis

**Color Palette:**
- Background: Coffee/brown theme (#2a211b, #3a2f27, #4a3a30)
- Accents: Teal (#8ddbcf), Purple (#d5b0ff), Yellow (#ffe8a3)
- Text: Warm white (#fffaf5)

**Typography:**
- System fonts (Inter, Roboto fallback)
- Limited font weight hierarchy
- Basic letter spacing

### Issues Identified

1. **Color Theme**: The coffee/brown palette, while unique, may not convey "cutting-edge tech consulting" effectively
2. **Contrast**: Some accent colors lack sufficient contrast against brown backgrounds
3. **Typography**: Generic system fonts don't establish strong brand identity
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Limited use of font weights and sizes
5. **Modern Feel**: The warm browns feel cozy but may not signal innovation

### Recommended Improvements

#### Option 1: Modern Tech Palette (Recommended)
A sophisticated dark theme with refined accents that signals innovation and professionalism.

#### Option 2: Refined Coffee Theme
Keep the coffee theme but enhance it with better contrast and modern touches.

#### Option 3: Neutral Professional
Clean, minimal palette focused on content and trust-building.
