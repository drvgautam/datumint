  **DatumInt** is a semantic data engineering practice based in Trondheim, Norway.

  The mission is simple:
  help organisations move from raw data to *understandable* data — the kind of data AI can reason over, reuse, and trust.

  ### What we build

  - **Knowledge graphs & ontologies**
    Your core concepts (assets, materials, customers, processes, regulations) become explicit, queryable, and machine-readable — not trapped in PDFs and ad-hoc spreadsheets.

  - **FAIR data pipelines**
    We design pipelines that collect, clean, label, and publish data with metadata and lineage, so it can be found, accessed, interoperated with, and reused (FAIR).

  - **GenAI with context**
    Retrieval-augmented generation backed by a semantic layer, not a random vector dump. Answers that reference your governed sources, not hallucinations.

  - **Operational delivery**
    We ship this using open standards and cloud-native tooling (containers, Kubernetes, observability, security), so you can run it yourself — not rent it forever.

  ## Principles

  1. **Semantics first.**
     Meaning is an architectural decision, not an afterthought bolted onto dashboards.

  2. **Small, observable pipelines.**
     If you can't monitor it, you can't trust it.

  3. **Open standards over lock-in.**
     RDF, R2RML mappings, DCAT-style catalogs, well-documented APIs.

  4. **You own the model.**
     The knowledge graph is an asset, not a subscription.

  ## Who is behind DatumInt?

  DatumInt is led by **Vinay Gautam**.

  Background: semantic data infrastructure in EU research projects (materials science, industrial processes, digital twins), FAIR data management, and hands-on delivery of data/ML platforms with Kubernetes, CI/CD, and observability.

  The work sits at the intersection of data engineering, semantic web, and platform engineering.
