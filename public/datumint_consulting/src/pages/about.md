  <p class="about-intro">
    <strong>DatumInt</strong> is a semantic data engineering practice based in Trondheim, Norway.
  </p>

  <p class="about-mission">
    The mission is simple: help organisations move from raw data to <em>understandable</em> data — the kind of data AI can reason over, reuse, and trust.
  </p>

  <h3 class="about-heading">What we build</h3>

  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Knowledge graphs & ontologies</strong><br>
      Your core concepts (assets, materials, customers, processes, regulations) become explicit, queryable, and machine-readable — not trapped in PDFs and ad-hoc spreadsheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>FAIR data pipelines</strong><br>
      We design pipelines that collect, clean, label, and publish data with metadata and lineage, so it can be found, accessed, interoperated with, and reused (FAIR).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GenAI with context</strong><br>
      Retrieval-augmented generation backed by a semantic layer, not a random vector dump. Answers that reference your governed sources, not hallucinations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational delivery</strong><br>
      We ship this using open standards and cloud-native tooling (containers, Kubernetes, observability, security), so you can run it yourself — not rent it forever.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="about-heading">Principles</h3>

  <ol class="about-principles">
    <li>
      <strong>Semantics first.</strong><br>
      Meaning is an architectural decision, not an afterthought bolted onto dashboards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Small, observable pipelines.</strong><br>
      If you can't monitor it, you can't trust it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Open standards over lock-in.</strong><br>
      RDF, R2RML mappings, DCAT-style catalogs, well-documented APIs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>You own the model.</strong><br>
      The knowledge graph is an asset, not a subscription.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="about-heading">Who is behind DatumInt?</h3>

  <p>
    DatumInt is led by <strong>Vinay Gautam</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Background: semantic data infrastructure in EU research projects (materials science, industrial processes, digital twins), FAIR data management, and hands-on delivery of data/ML platforms with Kubernetes, CI/CD, and observability.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work sits at the intersection of data engineering, semantic web, and platform engineering.
