Below is how DatumInt helps teams go from “we have messy data” to “we have a semantic platform our AI can trust.”

### 1. Semantic data platform / knowledge graph

We model your core domain (equipment, processes, materials, assets, customers, etc.) into a shared ontology and knowledge graph.
**Outcome:** a consistent source of truth that both humans and LLMs can understand.

### 2. FAIR data pipelines

We design and implement ingestion, transformation, validation, and publishing pipelines with traceability and metadata.
**Outcome:** data products that are discoverable, governed, and reusable across teams.

### 3. GenAI with context

We build retrieval-augmented assistants that answer questions using your approved sources, with citations.
**Outcome:** not just “AI”, but a system you can show to auditors, customers, and management.

### 4. Cloud-native delivery

We package the above as infrastructure you actually control: containers, Kubernetes, observability, security basics, and handover docs.

## How an engagement works

**Step 1 — Assessment Sprint (1–2 weeks)**  
We map your data landscape, identify high-value concepts, and outline a semantic model + target architecture.

**Step 2 — Pilot Build (4–6 weeks)**  
We deliver one working vertical slice: ontology + pipeline + serving (API or GenAI assistant). This is something you can demo.

**Step 3 — Handover & Enablement**  
You get the code, infra manifests, docs, and patterns to extend internally.
