<!DOCTYPE html><meta charset="utf-8"><p>Below is how DatumInt helps teams go from “we have messy data” to “we have a semantic platform our AI can trust.”</p>
<h3 id="1-semantic-data-platform--knowledge-graph">1. Semantic data platform / knowledge graph</h3>
<p>We model your core domain (equipment, processes, materials, assets, customers, etc.) into a shared ontology and knowledge graph.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> a consistent source of truth that both humans and LLMs can understand.</p>
<h3 id="2-fair-data-pipelines">2. FAIR data pipelines</h3>
<p>We design and implement ingestion, transformation, validation, and publishing pipelines with traceability and metadata.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> data products that are discoverable, governed, and reusable across teams.</p>
<h3 id="3-genai-with-context">3. GenAI with context</h3>
<p>We build retrieval-augmented assistants that answer questions using your approved sources, with citations.
<strong>Outcome:</strong> not just “AI”, but a system you can show to auditors, customers, and management.</p>
<h3 id="4-cloud-native-delivery">4. Cloud-native delivery</h3>
<p>We package the above as infrastructure you actually control: containers, Kubernetes, observability, security basics, and handover docs.</p>

<h2 id="how-an-engagement-works">How an engagement works</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1 — Assessment Sprint (1–2 weeks)</strong><br>
We map your data landscape, identify high-value concepts, and outline a semantic model + target architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 — Pilot Build (4–6 weeks)</strong><br>
We deliver one working vertical slice: ontology + pipeline + serving (API or GenAI assistant). This is something you can demo.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 — Handover &#x26; Enablement</strong><br>
You get the code, infra manifests, docs, and patterns to extend internally.</p>
