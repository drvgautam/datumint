- Designed and deployed scalable REST APIs using FastAPI for seamless integration with data sources associated with modelling and simulation tools.
- Developed cloud-based process modeling tool using Python, Docker and Kubernetes, enabling seamless web access for complex engineering simulations: [Process Modeling tool](#)
- Designed and implemented ETL pipelines to collect, process and integrate data to build a chemical coatings knowledge graph using Neo4J graph database. Developed a schema for coatings and used knowledge graph techniques to enable efficient query capabilities using Cypher.
- Developed an MVP of virtual knowledge graph using fastAPI, RDF triple store and SPARQL query language. Leveraged R2RML for mappings and Morph-KGC Python library to materialize knowledge graph from tabular data. The virtualized knowledge graph was stored in a Fuseki triple store and queried using Jena Fuseki SPARQL Endpoint.
- Deployed a Jupyterhub-based web service, supporting remote access of desktop applications near the data source: [XDSD web service](#)
