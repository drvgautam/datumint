* Designed and deployed scalable **REST APIs** (FastAPI) for integration with modelling and simulation systems.
* Developed cloud-based **[process modelling tools](https://github.com/ntnu-simlab/process-modelling-tools)** using Python, Docker, and Kubernetes, enabling browser-based execution of complex engineering simulations.
* Built ETL pipelines to collect, clean, and integrate multi-source data to construct a **coatings knowledge graph** using Neo4j; designed schemas and optimized Cypher queries for high-throughput workloads.
* Developed an MVP of a **virtualized knowledge graph system** using FastAPI, RDF triplestores, and SPARQL; implemented declarative mappings (R2RML, Morph-KGC) for materializing graph views from tabular data.
* Built a JupyterHub-based secure data-access service enabling remote access to NTNU's on-site modelling tools.

**Expertise demonstrated:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Neo4j, R2RML, SPARQL, ETL, semantic data engineering.
