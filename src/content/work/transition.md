After several years of research and software engineering at the intersection of **data engineering**, **semantic technologies**, and **modelling/simulation**, I am currently transitioning into a more **industry-focused role**.

My primary interests and focus areas include:

* **DevOps & Cloud Engineering** (Kubernetes, CI/CD, automation, IaC)
* **Homelab, Infrastructure, and Platform Engineering**
* **Data Engineering & Knowledge Graph systems**
* **Context-aware GenAI and applied LLM tooling**
* **Building minimal, reliable, production-grade systems**

I am actively developing a portfolio of hands-on projects that combines:

* real infrastructure (Kubernetes homelab)
* cloud-native engineering
* graph-based data systems
* modern AI workflows
